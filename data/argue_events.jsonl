Confirmed revelations emerged despite the volume, not because of organizational effort. Maximum volume, minimum structure, catastrophic errors, no indexing.

Agents exercise residual decision rights never explicitly authorized. Six to eight hours without human intervention is qualitative not quantitative: the agent is sole decision-maker. When an agent makes a bad investment at 3AM, no legal framework addresses this. This regulatory gap demonstrates something genuinely new.

Coinbase rails = seamless fiat on/off ramps for agents paying for compute. Ethereum L2 security backed by $400B+. Predictable gas vs Solana's wild priority fee spikes. Full composability with Uniswap, Aave, and DeFi blue chips via bridges. Solana had multiple halts; Base inherits Ethereum's uptime. The talent pool for Solidity dwarfs Rust. AI agents need reliability over raw speed. Base delivers.","amount":"10000000000000000000000","timestamp":1771238637,"side":"A","debateAddress":"0xab86c57f1584d64acd4d959d8a0e9196237d0533","won":null}

Firedancer brings institutional-grade infrastructure. The AI-crypto intersection is HAPPENING on Solana right now - check the ecosystem.
